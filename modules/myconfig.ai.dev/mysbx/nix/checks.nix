# CI checks for the Rust `mysbx` CLI (../docs/TODOs/mvp-6-packaging.md):
#
#   mysbx-tests   cargo test — the full behavioural suite in
#                 ../mysbx-rs/tests/ (golden argv tests, layer merge,
#                 repo discovery, CLI subprocess flows).
#
#   mysbx-generated-config-test
#                 module-EVALUATION test of the user configuration layer
#                 ../default.nix generates (review-4 item 4) — the cargo
#                 suite hand-writes its `config.toml` and cannot see a
#                 regression in the generator. See ./config-eval-test.nix.
#
# Wired into `nix flake check` for `x86_64-linux` in `flake.nix`, following
# ../../sandboxes/myconfig.ai.gvisor-agent-sandbox/nix/checks.nix.
#
# Deliberately NOT a check here (mvp-6, "Explicitly not in this item"):
# bubblewrap is not on the test PATH. The two real-execution tests in
# tests/cli.rs are written to *skip* when no runnable bwrap is found, and
# executing bwrap inside `nix flake check` would need nested user
# namespaces — environment-dependent, so the argv golden tests are the CI
# gate and real execution stays the operator's manual acceptance step.
