* How to bootstrap
** on NixOS:
first install NixOS, e.g. with the scripts in [[./misc/bootstrap]] or [[https://gist.github.com/martijnvermaat/76f2e24d0239470dd71050358b4d5134][this guide]]. Then
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maxhbr/myconfig ~/myconfig
$ cd ~/myconfig
$ echo -n "HOSTNAME" | sudo tee ./hostname
$ ./rebuild.sh
#+END_SRC

* How it is composed

- Entrypoint is the file ~./default.nix~.
- It loads the corresponding ~./hosts/${host}.nix~, depending on the content of ~./hostname~
- This then loads profiles and composes the configuration.

** Hosts
The folder ~./hosts~ contains the top-level files for my machines, which compose the configuration

*** ~./hosts/hardware/~
This folder contains hardware related stuff. It uses the great repository [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware][nixOS/nixos-hardware]] for additional configuration.

** Modules
The top level modules and other interesting ones are:

** Other Stuff
*** ~./misc/bootstrap/~
This contains documentation about how to bootstrap and setup my machines. It also contains a Packer based test for this setup.
*** ~./misc/dotfiles_without_nix/~ (work in progress)
This contains a bunch of scripts and symlinks, which should help to bootstrap my dotfiles on an non-Nix machine.
*** ~./misc/guix/~ (work in progress)
Some notes related to my experiments with GuixSD.
*** ~./misc/ARM_Smart_Home_Server/~ (work in progress)
Configuration for my non-Nixos Raspberry Pis and Odroids, which I use for smarthome stuff.
The longterm goal is to migrate them to NixOS.
